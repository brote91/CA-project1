        <h2>Welcome to My Website</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Chris! I'm transitioning from 15 years as a custom cabinet
          maker to becoming a full-stack software engineer. This site is part of
          my journey—thanks for stopping by!

      <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a self-taught web developer, husband, and dad to an amazing
          daughter. After years of building high-quality custom cabinets and
          managing a family business, I decided to pursue a lifelong interest in
          technology. I’m currently taking the Full-Stack Engineer course on
          Codecademy and building projects to sharpen my frontend and backend
          skills. I hope to eventually transition from trade to tech and
          completly change my career.

        <h2>My Education</h2>
        <p>
          I’m enrolled in the Full-Stack Engineer program at Codecademy. My
          self-driven education is backed by countless hours of studying,
          building, and experimenting—on a mission to become job-ready.

      <section id="experience">
        <h2>My Experience</h2>
        <p>
          I spent 15 years running a custom cabinet business with my father,
          managing client needs, operations, and all hands-on shop production.
          That experience taught me attention to detail, problem-solving under
          pressure, and the importance of craftsmanship—skills I now apply to
          code.

      <section id="hobbies">
        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
          Spending time with my wife and daughter, I love running, learning, and
          being a full-time goof with my 17-month-old daughter. I’m also into
          tech podcasts and learning about SaaS startups and automation tools.
